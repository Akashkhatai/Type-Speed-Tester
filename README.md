# Type-Speed-Tester
I built a Typing Speed Tester web application that measures a userâ€™s typing speed and accuracy in real time. The app displays random text for users to type and calculates words per minute (WPM), characters per minute (CPM), and error count. It is designed with a responsive interface, smooth user experience, and instant performance feedback.
